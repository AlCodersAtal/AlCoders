    <h2>How to make an LDR controlled LED</h2>

    <p>
      An LDR-controlled LED uses a Light Dependent Resistor to sense light
      levels and control an LED's state based on the surrounding brightness. The
      LDR forms a voltage divider with a resistor, and its output voltage
      changes with light intensity. This voltage is read by the Arduino through
      an analog pin. The Arduino compares the reading to a predefined threshold
      to decide whether to turn the LED on or off. If the environment is dark
      (high LDR resistance, higher voltage), the LED turns on; in bright
      conditions (low LDR resistance, lower voltage), the LED turns off. The
      circuit consists of an LDR connected to a 10kΩ resistor forming a voltage
      divider, with one end connected to 5V, the other to ground, and the
      midpoint connected to the Arduino’s analog pin. The LED is connected to a
      digital pin via a 220Ω resistor.

            3  int threshold = 500;         // Threshold value to determine light/dark

Explanation of Code with Line Numbers:
    Lines 1-3: Define the pins for the LDR and LED and set the light/dark threshold.
    Lines 5-8: Initialize the LED pin as output and start the serial communication for debugging.
    Lines 10-21: Continuously read the LDR value, compare it to the threshold, and control the LED accordingly.
    Debugging information is printed on the Serial Monitor.</pre
